            <h2>Big literature and assessements</h2>
            <img src = 'Big literature/4vs.png' style="width:700px;object-fit:cover">
            <p><strong>The 4V's of big literature</strong>. The varying challenges of assessing large, rapidly growing and diverse scientific literatures. Currently unpublished.</p>

            <img src = 'Big literature/PEM pathways.png' style="height:350px;object-fit:cover">
            <p><strong>The Pragmatic Enlightened Model (PEM)</strong>. PEM is a form of science-policy deliberation that takes place during assessments. It is a process designed to arrive at socially mandated, but scientifically informed, pathways towards climate stabilisation. Unpublished version based on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1462901115000660" target="_blank">Edenhofer and Kowarsch 2015</a>.</p>

            <img src = 'Big literature/systematic review funnel 2.png' style="height:350px;object-fit:cover">
            <p><strong>Stages of Evidence Synthesis</strong>. Evidence synthesis approaches apply formal methodologies to integrate varying research results, producing a systematic review with minimal biases. Currently unpublished.</p>


            <h2>Human well-being and political economy</h2>
            <img src = 'Well-being/goldembergs corner.png' style="width:700px;object-fit:cover">
            <p><strong>Carbon emissions, human well-being and Goldemberg's Corner</strong>. Emissions and human well-being outcomes are tightly coupled up to approximately 3t CO2/capita. Beyond this threshold the relationship saturates, with increasing energy and emissions delivering only marginal gains in life expectancy. This relationship is similar across many <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-018-0021-4" target="_blank">variations</a> of environmental pressure and well-being outcomes.</p>

            <img src = 'Well-being/WB theory applications.png' style="width:700px;object-fit:cover">
            <p><strong>Well-being theories and applications</strong>. Different conceptualisations of well-being hold varying claims regarding the utility and context of consumption. These subsequently imply different strategies to address climate change.

            <h2>Negative emissions</h2>
            <img src = 'NETs/Paper 1/Fig1_NETs vs CDR.png' style="width:700px;object-fit:cover">
            <p><strong>Negative emissions technologies (NETs): mitigation or adaptation?</strong> NETs address fundamental causes of climate change (heat trapping greenhouse gases), unlike solar radiation management, with addresses the consequences and impacts of climate change. Conceptually, NETs sit closer to mitigation strategies. Published in <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aabf9b" target="_blank">Minx, Lamb et al. 2018</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>The costs, potentials and side-effects of negative emissions technologies (NETs)</strong>. This figure synthesizes a comprehensive and systematic assessment of NETs along multiple dimensions.

            <p><strong>Technology analogues for negative emissions upscaling</strong>. Direct air capture will reach widespread adoption by the end of the century, if it follows a similar innovation timeline to solar PV.
